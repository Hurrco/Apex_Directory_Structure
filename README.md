# PARA-based Knowledge Management System

This repository is a structured file system for managing personal and professional information, based on the PARA (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives) method. It is designed to be a single source of truth for all digital assets, from project files to personal documents.

## Structure

The repository is organized into the following top-level directories:

- **`00_INBOX`**: A temporary holding area for all new files.
- **`01_HORIZONS`**: High-level goals and life vision.
- **`02_PROJECTS`**: Actionable projects with defined goals and deadlines.
- **`03_AREAS`**: Ongoing areas of responsibility with no end date.
- **`04_RESOURCES`**: A library of reference materials and assets.
- **`05_OUTPUTS`**: Final, polished work and creations.
- **`09_ARCHIVE`**: Inactive items from the other categories.

For a detailed explanation of the structure and rules for using this system, please refer to `RULES.md`.
